    <h2>1. Pyramid game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask user to enter natural number N  (0&lt;N&lt;=20) // use prompt()
      </li>
      <li>
        If number N is not natural or doesn`t match required range, 
        output error message in console // For example: 
        console.error(‘Incorrect!’);
      </li>
      <li>
        If N match all requirements 
        you should build and output in console pyramid with N floors
      </li>
      <li>
        To build pyramid use spaces, square brackets, 
        tilde and \n (new line) characters.

    <h2>2. Guessing game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Show a message ‘Do you want to play a game?’ // use confirm()
      </li>
      <li>
        If user clicked ‘Cancel’ – output in console message 
        `You did not become a millionaire`, if clicked ‘Ok’ – start a game: 
        randomly /* Math.random() */ choose a number in range [0; 5], and ask 
        user to enter a number
      </li>
      <li>
        User has 3 attempts to guess a number
      </li>
      <li>
        If user guessed number on 1-st attempt prize is 10$ 
        (maximum prize for current numbers range), 2-nd attempt – 5$, 
        3-rd attempt – 2$
      </li>
      <li>
        If user did not guess a number, output in console message 
        ‘Thank you for a game. Your prize is: …’, and ask if he wants 
        to play again.
      </li>
      <li>
        If user did guess - ask if he wants to continue 
        a game // use confirm().
      </li>
      <li>
        If user does not want to continue – output in console 
        message ‘Thank you for a game. Your prize is: …’, and 
        ask if he wants to play again.
      </li>
      <li>
        If user does want to continue, make number range twice 
        as big as the previous one /* for example [0; 5] -> [0; 10] 
        */, and three times bigger maximum prize /* for example on 
        1-st attempt prize will be 30$, 2-nd attempt – 15$, 3-rd 
        attempt – 7$ */. Prize must be added to the previous one 
        and number of attempts should be set to 3 (user should has 
        3 attempts to guess a number for each numbers range)
      </li>
      <li>
        Each time you ask user to enter a number /* using prompt() 
        */ you should show him a range of numbers, how much attempts 
        he has left, his total prize and possible prize on current attempt.
